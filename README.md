This is the first AED Assignment!

The two use cases are:

1.Create a person profile
2.Display a person profile

Created a java application using NetBeans IDE and defined a person's profile with required attributes and I'm able to view it.

Added basic required validations for each field (i.e Fax number has 7 digits etc.)

Gave an option to Upload photo and it will be displayed in the view section.

All the details are to be entered in the Create Panel.
